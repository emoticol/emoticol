# emoticol
Emoticol is an Instant Messaging protocol that relies heavily on emoticons

#####Conversation Initiation Commands

**`:|`**  -  Initiate casual conversation.  Requires a response of **`:|`**.  This was the first emoticol command, the intent is to prevent launching into a conversation at an inopportune time or place for the recipient.

**`:|` `:|`** - Initiate time sensitive conversation. Requires a response of **`:|` `:|`**.  This initiation sequence is used when you have really good information you are eager to share.  Not necessarily urgent, but might be worth responding in situations when you might ignore a **`:|`**.

**`:| :| :|`** - Initiate urgent conversation. Requires a response of **`:| :| :|`**. Will be escalated to other communication methods if no response recieved.

**`@`** - request for a focused conversation, the equivalent of 'got a minute' in the real world, respond with **`@`** when appropriate focus can be granted, otherwise standard casual conversation may continue if previously initiated.  Urgency is not implied, unless combined with **`:|` `:|`** or **`:| :| :|`**

**`aa`** - "ask about", appended to a conversation initation request so that the requestor doesn't forget what they were going to say.  Intended to be vague, assume message could be intercepted.  Example -  *`:| aa meeting today`*

**`fyi`** - "general information", appended to a conversation initation request so the requestor can share some interesting fact that doesn't require any further conversation. Example - *`:| fyi http://somelink`*


**`-_-`**  -  Can't respond at the moment.

#####In Conversation Commands

**`ack`** - I have seen your message but have no comment

**`^`** - I think you may have missed a comment above, please respond or **`ack`**

**`(?)`** - "Anything to Report?" or  "How's it going?"

**`%`** - used to question the authenticity of a statement.  Report the % you believe a statement to be true, originator of the statment must respond with the actual % true.

**`=`** - used to correct a typo in a previous statement, example: "my internal diagnostics idicate memory systems are functioning within normal parameters.  idicate=indicate"

**`?20`** - "Where are you?"

**`omw`** - "On my way"

**`goml`** - "Get off my lawn!" - Can be used in two ways.  The first is in response to someone saying something like "Hey, did you see that the new iPhone 17 is out?".  A `goml` response here would mean that the respondent is not interested in such fancy new contraptions, their bag phone works just fine thank you very nice.  The second would be as a mild epithet used in response to someone saying something like "That new iPhone 17 is garbage.  What's a phone without a screen?  I'm not getting those ocular implants."  A `goml` response here is the respondent poking fun at the OP.
