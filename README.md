# emoticol
Emoticol is an Instant Messaging protocol that relies heavily on emoticons

#####Conversation Initiation Commands

**`:|`**  -  Initiate casual conversation.  Requires a response of **`:|`**.  This was the first emoticol command, the intent is to prevent launching into a conversation at an inopportune time or place for the recipient.

**`:|` `:|`** - Initiate time sensitive conversation. Requires a response of **`:|` `:|`**.  This initiation sequence is used when you have really good information you are eager to share.  Not necessarily urgent, but might be worth responding in situations when you might ignore a **`:|`**.

**`:|`` :|`` :|`** - Initiate urgent conversation. Requires a response of **`:|`` :|`` :|`**. Will be escalated to other communication methods if no response recieved.

**`@`** - request for a focused conversation, the equivalent of 'got a minute' in the real world, respond with **`@`** when appropriate focus can be granted, otherwise standard casual conversation may continue if previously initiated.  Urgency is not implied, unless combined with **`:|` `:|`** or **`:|`` :|`` :|`**

**`aa`** - "ask about", appended to a conversation initation request so that the requestor doesn't forget what they were going to say.  Intended to be vague, assume message could be intercepted.  Example -  *`:| aa meeting today`*

**`-_-`**  -  Can't respond at the moment.

#####In Conversation Commands

**`ack`** - I have seen your message but have no comment

**`^`** - I think you may have missed a comment above, please respond or **`ack`**

**`(ASL)`** - "Anything to Report?"  aka "How's it going?"

**`%`** - used to question the authenticity of a statement.  Report the % you believe a statement to be true, originator of the statment must respond with the actual % true.

**`=`** - used to correct a typo in a previous statement, example: "my internal diagnostics idicate memory systems are functioning within normal parameters.  idicate=indicate"
