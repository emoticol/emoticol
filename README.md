# emoticol
Emoticol is an Instant Messaging protocol that relies heavily on emoticons

#####Conversation Initiation Commands

**`:|`**  -  Initiate casual conversation.  Requires a response of **`:|`**.  This was the first emoticol command, the intent is to prevent launching into a conversation at an inopportune time or place for the recipient.

**`:|` `:|`** - Initiate time sensitive conversation. Requires a response of **`:|` `:|`**.  This initiation sequence is used when you have really good information you are eager to share.  Not necessarily urgent, but might be worth responding in situations when you might ignore a **`:|`**.

**`:|`` :|`` :|`** - Initiate urgent conversation. Requires a response of **`:|`` :|`` :|`**. Will be escalated to other communication methods if no response recieved.

**`aa`** - "ask about", appended to a conversation initation request so that the requestor doesn't forget what they were going to say.  Intended to be vague, assume message could be intercepted.  Example -  *`:| aa meeting today`*

**`fyi`** - "general information", appended to a conversation initation request so the requestor can share some interesting fact that doesn't require any further conversation. Example - *`:| fyi http://somelink`*

#####In Conversation Commands

**`ack`** - I have seen your message but have no comment

**`^`** - I think you may have missed a comment above, please respond or **`ack`**

**`(ASL)`** - "Anything to Report?"  aka "How's it going?"

**`%`** - used to question the authenticity of a statement.  Report the % you believe a statement to be true, originator of the statment must respond with the actual % true.
